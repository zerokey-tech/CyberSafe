    <p>Humans are inherently complex and multi-faceted creatures with our own agendas, influences, faults, beliefs, and priorities. Sometimes we’re also simply just too trusting. Even the most hardened system can be breached through social engineering the‘hacking’ of people. No amount of secure network topologies and firewalls or security software can withstand a user innocently clicking on an email link, or being convinced to give up login details .</p>
    
    <p>From the home user through to industry and government, everyone needs a basic understanding of cyberthreats and how to recognise them –something which comes under the umbrella of digital literacy.</p>
    
    <p>When it comes to security you can never completely eliminate risk, you can only minimise and mitigate
        it – there is no such thing as the 100% secure system. The adage goes that the only truly
        secure computer is locked in a lead box, buried fifty feet underground,sealed with concrete, with no wired or wireless connections in or out.And turned off.Which is to say, not a very useful computer.</p>
    <p>so to ensure that your dataa remains yours</p>
    <p>• Use complex passwords over simple ones, and don’t re-use passwords between sites and services. If you find passwords hard to remember, use a password manager.<br/>
• When on offer, use two-factor authentication. This is becoming more common now with various services to ensure others can’t log in as you, even if they manage to attain your passwords.<br/>
• Learn to recognise phishing emails– listen to that nagging voice in your head: if it sounds suspicious,
it is. Banks, government services,and reputable companies won’t askfor your login details over email.<br/>
• Don’t open files from someone you don’t know, and don’t download or install any files delivered through pop-ups or pop-unders during web browsing.<br/>
• Keep your operating system and your applications up-to-date with the latest patches.</p>
